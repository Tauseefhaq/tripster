      <h1>Our story</h1>
      <p>
        Tripster is a solo project by Mohammed Tauseef Ul-Haq created for the
        sole purpose of showing the creator's prowess over the basic
        fundamantals of React and Web Dev. It is a mock site of a travel agency
        with listing popular sites and other basic functions like routing and
        dynamic components.

      <h1>Why Tripster</h1>
      <p>
        There is no reason to pick Tripster over sites like Trivago or
        TripAdvisor but hey, why not just visit and admire the beauty of the
        solo project huh? And unlike those huge sites this was created by a
        single person so yes, be amazed!!!!!!!
      </p>
      <h1>Vision</h1>
      <p>
        The vision is to get practice and command over these simple topics and
        get employed.
